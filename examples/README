                    Memoize Example
                    ===============

Shows how to memoize a set of subs using a regular expression. Two
calibrators are created, and some colors are calibrated on them. We
use several sets of parameters to demo that Memoize is using keys
correctly.

Sample output:

  Trying [RGB:acme:red] twice
          Computed result: 255 0 0
          Memoized result: 255 0 0

  Trying [RGB:zerox:red]
          Computed result: 255 0 0

  Trying [RGB:acme:blue]
          Computed result: 0 0 255

  Trying [CYMK:acme:cyan] twice
          Computed result: 100 0 0 0
          Memoized result: 100 0 0 0
