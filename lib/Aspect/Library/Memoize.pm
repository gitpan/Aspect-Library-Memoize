=head1 NAME

Aspect::Library::Memoize - Cross-cutting memoization

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # memoize all subs that have '_slow_' in their name, under package MyApp
  aspect Memoize => call qr/^MyApp::.*_slow_/;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An aspect interface on the Memoize module. Only difference from Memoize
module is that you can specify subs to be memoized using pointcuts.

Works by memoizing on the 1st call, and calling the memoized version on
subsequent calls.
