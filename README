NAME
    Aspect::Library::Memoize - Cross-cutting memoization

SYNOPSIS
      # memoize all subs that have '_slow_' in their name, under package MyApp
      aspect Memoize => call qr/^MyApp::.*_slow_/;

SUPER
    Aspect::Modular

DESCRIPTION
    An aspect interface on the Memoize module. Only difference from Memoize
    module is that you can specify subs to be memoized using pointcuts.

    Works by memoizing on the 1st call, and calling the memoized version on
    subsequent calls.

    directory of the distribution.
